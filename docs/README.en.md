# Manpages

Since `git help sum` will try to fetch a manpage, we're providing one.

To install `man` pages, use:

    sudo git spend man --install

> That API is very experimental and is likely to change in the future, which is why it's hidden for now.

or, if you cloned this source tree:

    make install-man

> â€¦ and now a debian package makes sense ;
> can't find yet if `go get` allows hooks for this.
